        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            <u>[ I'll come back and clean this up later, this is just to get information out there. ]</u><br><br>

            I'm Aubrey and thanks for checking out the about me page.
            I am a 24 year old trans woman from southwestern Ohio. I like to call myself a jack of all trades, master of none who specialises in some areas.
            I've done all sorts of things, from texture work, to programming to modelling shenanigans and more.
            <br><br>
            I am largley self-taught on texture work, Unity and Blender so if a dingus like me can do it, by just poking at it and seeing what happens, you can too!

            I'm an amatuer meteorologist, and often follow severe weather outbreaks when they happen.

            I went to college for a bachelor's in cybersecurity and IT, and have spent the last five years programming in many different languages.
            <br><br>

            Games:
            I generally play open world non-linear RPGS like the Fallout series, Elder Scrolls series and Starbound. I also enjoy open world sandbox games like
            Minecraft, Garry's mod and more...and modding the everloving crap out of these games because that's just what you do.

            <br><br>
            Experience:
            Professionally, I worked in I.T. at a small computer repair shop for about a year and worked as a "Full Stack developer" for about six months.
            I have roughly three years in web development experience that has come together to form this website you're looking at now.
            Simultaneously, I have three years of Java experience and have done various projects listed on my Github including a character generator and a custom modded Minecraft modpack installer.

            <br><br>
