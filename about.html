                    Howdy! I'm Aubrey and thanks for checking out the about me page.
                    I am a 24 year old trans woman (she/hers) from southwestern Ohio. I like to call myself a jack of all trades, master of none who specialises in some areas.
                    I've done all sorts of things, from texture work, to programming, 3D modelling shenanigans and more.

                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    I am largley self-taught on texture work, Unity and Blender so if a dingus like me can do it by just poking at it and seeing what happens, you can too!<br>

                    I'm an amatuer meteorologist, and often follow severe weather outbreaks when they happen.<br>

                    I went to college for a bachelor's in cybersecurity and IT, and have over five years of programming experience in many different languages (Java being my most used).<br>

                    <h3>Games:</h3>
                    In terms of games, I generally play open world non-linear RPGS like the Fallout series, Elder Scrolls series (Except ESO) and Starbound. I also enjoy open world sandbox games like
                    Minecraft, Gmod and more...and modding the everloving crap out of these games because that's just what you do with them.

                    <h3>Texture Experience:</h3>
                    I have been doing texture work for about three years across four games. (Skyrim, MSFS 2020, Subnautica and VR Chat). I started with doing simple texture edits in Skyrim mods playing around with making custom races, only being able to heavily edit existing textures.
                    Eventually I met someone who taught me the ropes of Substance Painter and got me down the right track. This is around when I did a little bit of texture work for the A32NX in MSFS 2020 (The cockpit text decals).<br><br>

                    Next thing I did after this was make a battery mod for Subnautica and made textures for it. Then I got to playing around with what I was trying to do before Painter, which was to create a custom goat race in Skyrim. Took me quite a while but I got it done after about a month or two.
                    I had also figured out how to do outfit re-textures in Skyrim during this journey. About a year and a half pass of me playing with Painter off and on, refining my skills and learning how Skyrim's texture formats work.<br><br>

                    More time passes until August 2022 when I discovered VR Chat. At this point, I already had about two years of texture experience under my belt so the most difficulty of making avatars was figuring out Unity itself and how it worked. 
                    This took the better part of three to four months before I was able to easily do anything more than simple toggles and importing packages. After more time passes I felt confident enough to start doing commissions. <br><br>
					
					Along the way, I was tooling around with Blender using my tried and true method of "Mess around and find out". After enough time of doing so, I can say I can do some refits, simple custom props and some splicing.

                    <h3>Computer Science Background and Experience:</h3>
                    I got my start when I was younger, playing a (sadly) long since dead game called Mars Explorer. You played as a small vehicle roving around community made worlds with up to ten other people online. 
                    I wanted to try and make a world in this game. At the time Unity + Blender went way over the head of a 13 year old me.  However, this ignited a small fire for game development that smouldered for a few years.<br><br>

                    I did some playing around with Arduinos (C++) sometime afterwards, and eventually played with Raspberry Pis in High school and picked up some Python then.  In college, is really where it picked up. 
                    Classes I took in no particular order: Python, Java 1 and 2, Game Development, mySQL, Web Development 1 (HTML, CSS, JS), Web Development 2 (PHP) , and C. <br><br>
                    Professionally, I worked in I.T. at a small computer repair shop for about a year and worked as a "Full Stack developer" for about six months.
                    I have roughly three years in web development experience, with "raw" HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also have experience with PHP and mySQL.
                    Simultaneously, I have four years of Java experience and have done various projects listed on my Github including a character generator and a custom modded minecraft modpack installer.
