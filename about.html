        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            Howdy! I'm Aubrey and thanks for checking out the about me page.
            I am a 24 year old trans woman (she/hers) from southwestern Ohio. I like to call myself a jack of all trades, master of none who specialises in some areas.
            I've done all sorts of things, from texture work, to programming, 3D modelling shenanigans and more.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am largley self-taught on texture work, Unity and Blender so if a dingus like me can do it by just poking at it and seeing what happens, you can too!<br>

            I'm an amatuer meteorologist, and often follow severe weather outbreaks when they happen.<br>

            I went to college for a bachelor's in cybersecurity and IT, and have spent the last five years programming in many different languages.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="header">Games: </span> <br><!-- Because for *reasons* putting a header (h4) here breaks the HTML paragraph. -->
            In terms of games, I generally play open world non-linear RPGS like the Fallout series, Elder Scrolls series (Except ESO) and Starbound. I also enjoy open world sandbox games like
            Minecraft, Gmod and more...and modding the everloving crap out of these games because that's just what you do.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="header">Experience:</span><br> 
            Professionally, I worked in I.T. at a small computer repair shop for about a year and worked as a "Full Stack developer" for about six months. <br>
            I have roughly three years in web development experience, witgh "raw" HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also have experience with PHP and mySQL.<br>
            Simultaneously, I have four years of Java experience and have done various projects listed on my Github including a character generator and a custom modded minecraft modpack installer. <br>
